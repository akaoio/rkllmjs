# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implemented for the RKLLMJS project using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of four main workflows that automate testing, quality checks, security scanning, and deployment:

1. **Test & Quality Checks** (`test.yml`) - Continuous Integration
2. **Release & Publish** (`release.yml`) - Continuous Deployment  
3. **Security & Compliance** (`security.yml`) - Security Scanning
4. **CI/CD Monitoring** (`monitor.yml`) - Pipeline Monitoring

## Workflows

### 1. Test & Quality Checks (`test.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to `main`/`develop`, Pull Requests
**Purpose**: Validates code quality and functionality

**Jobs**:
- **Multi-Environment Testing**: Tests across Node.js 16, 18, 20 on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- **Code Quality Checks**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript compilation
- **Build Verification**: Ensures clean builds and artifact generation
- **Alternative Runtime Support**: Validates Bun and Deno compatibility
- **Test Coverage**: Runs comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting

**Key Features**:
- Uses npm caching for faster builds
- Uploads test logs as artifacts
- Enforces RULES.md compliance via `npm run validate`
- Continues on errors for non-critical checks

### 2. Release & Publish (`release.yml`)

**Triggers**: Git tags (`v*`), Manual workflow dispatch
**Purpose**: Automates releases and npm publishing

**Jobs**:
- **Create Release**: Generates GitHub releases with automatic changelogs
- **Publish to NPM**: Publishes package to npm registry
- **Deploy Documentation**: Builds and deploys TypeDoc documentation to GitHub Pages

**Key Features**:
- Supports both tag-based and manual releases
- Automatic version bumping with workflow dispatch
- Changelog generation from git history
- Artifact verification before publishing

### 3. Security & Compliance (`security.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push, Pull Requests, Daily schedule (2:00 AM UTC), Manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security and compliance scanning

**Jobs**:
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scan**: npm audit and audit-ci checks
- **Code Security Analysis**: GitHub CodeQL for static analysis
- **License Compliance**: Validates dependency licenses
- **Secret Scanning**: TruffleHog for potential secret detection
- **RULES.md Compliance**: Validates project compliance standards
- **Protected Files Check**: Ensures Rockchip library files integrity

**Key Features**:
- Daily automated security scans
- CodeQL integration with custom configuration
- License allowlist enforcement
- Secret detection with artifact uploads

### 4. CI/CD Monitoring (`monitor.yml`)

**Triggers**: Completion of other workflows
**Purpose**: Monitors pipeline health and creates alerts

**Features**:
- Workflow completion tracking
- Automatic issue creation for main branch failures
- Performance metrics collection
- Artifact analysis and reporting

## Configuration Files

### Dependabot (`dependabot.yml`)
- **NPM Dependencies**: Weekly updates on Mondays
- **GitHub Actions**: Weekly updates for workflow dependencies
- **Reviewers**: Automatically assigns maintainers
- **Labels**: Categorizes updates for easy management

### CodeQL Configuration (`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`)
- **Security & Quality Queries**: Comprehensive ruleset
- **Path Exclusions**: Ignores build artifacts and test files
- **Focused Scanning**: Targets source code and scripts

## Branch Protection Requirements

The pipeline is designed to support branch protection rules:

**Recommended Settings**:
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Required checks: `Test (Node.js 20 on ubuntu-latest)`, `Code Quality Checks`, `RULES.md Compliance Check`
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require linear history
- Include administrators in restrictions

## Templates

### Pull Request Template
- Comprehensive checklist covering testing, compliance, and documentation
- RULES.md compliance verification
- Breaking changes documentation
- Manual testing requirements

### Issue Templates
- **Bug Report**: Structured bug reporting with environment details
- **Feature Request**: Feature proposals with use cases and compatibility impact

## Secrets Configuration

The following secrets should be configured in the repository:

- `NPM_TOKEN`: For npm package publishing
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Success Indicators
- âœ… All tests pass across multiple environments
- âœ… Code quality checks pass
- âœ… Security scans show no high-priority issues
- âœ… RULES.md compliance maintained

### Failure Handling
- ðŸš¨ Automatic issue creation for main branch failures
- ðŸ“Š Performance metrics tracking
- ðŸ“‹ Detailed error reporting in workflow summaries
- ðŸ“¦ Artifact uploads for debugging

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Efficiency**: npm caching, matrix builds, continue-on-error for non-critical checks
2. **Security**: Regular dependency scanning, secret detection, license compliance
3. **Quality**: Multi-environment testing, code quality enforcement, documentation validation
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling, rollback strategies, monitoring
5. **Compliance**: RULES.md validation, protected file checks, consistent standards

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review Dependabot PRs weekly
- Monitor security scan results
- Update workflow versions quarterly
- Review and update branch protection rules

### Troubleshooting
- Check workflow run logs for detailed error information
- Review artifact uploads for debugging information
- Monitor issue tracker for automated failure reports
- Verify secret configuration if deployment fails

## Performance Optimization

The pipeline is optimized for GitHub Actions efficiency:
- **Dependency Caching**: Reduces build times by caching npm packages
- **Matrix Strategy**: Parallel execution across multiple environments
- **Conditional Execution**: Skip unnecessary steps based on context
- **Artifact Management**: 7-day retention for test logs, 30-day for security reports

This CI/CD pipeline ensures high code quality, security, and reliability while maintaining compliance with the project's strict development standards defined in RULES.md.
