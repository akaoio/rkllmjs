# lib

## Purpose
Compiled library artifacts for RKLLM C++ modules

## Overview
Contains the compiled static library files for the RKLLM manager and other C++ components. These libraries are generated during the build process and link with the Node.js native addon.

## Architecture
- **librkllm-manager.a**: Compiled RKLLM manager static library

## Dependencies
- C++ modules: core, inference, memory, adapters, utils
- Build system: Makefile-based modular build

## Usage
Libraries are automatically linked during the build process. No direct interaction required.

## Build
Generated by the modular build system:
```bash
npm run build:cpp
```

## Maintenance
Libraries are cleaned and rebuilt during clean builds to ensure consistency.
